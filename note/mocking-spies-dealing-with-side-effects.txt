Spies:
use spies if you don't care about what a function does but just wanna know whether it was executed for ex
you can wrap the function with such a spies object or replace the function which is more common
because it helps you get rid of the side effect
Mocks:
You often replace bigger of an api of a certain module or code
and with mocks you also often implement some test specific object in the replacement object
that does something else than the original function but helps you test different scenerios

vi.mock is hoisted to automatically to the top, for jest you have to call it on top of the file
before any imports

behind the scenes the test files that aren't mocked are getting called first
not sure if 2 files mocked different things will carry the mock with you but:
