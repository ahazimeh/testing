test runner executes your test ex: jest, karma
assertion library: used to define outcomes, check whether your expectations met ex: jest, chai

jest and vitest

jest still doesn't totally support es module syntax, it does but somehow slow and you need
to install some configuration

in the scripts "test": "vitest --globals"
globals flag so you can use special fns like it and expect without any extra imports
