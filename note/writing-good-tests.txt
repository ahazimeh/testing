what not to test:
your test should only test your code and not any third party code
    don't test browser apis, native nodejs packages::don't test what you can't change
    don't test your backend code implicitly by writing code into the frontend
    test your reaction to the response you get back when you are sending a request
Writing good tests:
    follow AAA rule
    only test one thing
    focus on the essence of a test when arranging::don't make things complicated
    keep the number of assertions ("expects") low
Only test one thing: one feature or behavious per test
