unit testing: it is about testing the individual unit blocks that makes up our application
    and all these building blocks are tested stand alone
integration testing: test the combination of building blocks
end to end testing: test the intire flow for a feature

test driven development:
    you don't write your app code first and then test driven code but
    first before writing any app code you write failing tests where at the end define
    the expected behaviour, then implement the code that should be tested
    then refactor and go throught the flow over and over again
